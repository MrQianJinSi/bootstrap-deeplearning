## Deep Learning: Problems
1. how to avoid overfitting(data normalization, batch normalizer, dropout)
2. how to reduce computation complexity(layer architecture, pooling, 1x1 CNN bridge)
3. how to converge more effectively (Gradient clap, Relu, Resnet)
4. how to build big dataset(ImageNet, Scannet, unsupervised learning)
5. how to accelerate training speed(Compiler Optimization, GPU, Distributing system)
6. how to reduce the difficulty of model design(Pytorch, tensorflow)
7. how to interpret the result of deep learning(visualization)
